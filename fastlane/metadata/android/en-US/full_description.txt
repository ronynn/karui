An open source, privacy focussed, todo list app to quickly jot down things to do. Inspired by the system-24 theme and the Windows Mobile design system, this app's design is set to evolve into something even more eye-catching.

Features

- Simple note taking and list making: Includes an undo delete feature.
- Retro terminalesque design: Inspired by Unix customizations found online.
- Lightweight: Consumes only 0.05% CPU and 128KB of RAM. After all, simple apps shouldn't need moreâ€”remember, the Apollo mission operated on a computer with around 4KB of RAM!
- Highly customizable: Offers many themes with plans to add more customizations such as fonts, font sizes, and border colors.
- To add a new note tab, use the `///TabName` format.
- To remove any tab (except the Main tab), use the `\\\TabName` format.
